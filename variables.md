#Variable Declaration
Vairables are commonly explicitly declared by the var statement, as shown below:<br>
var c;<br>
The above variable is created, but has the default value of undefined. To be of value, the variable needs
to be initialized: <br>
var c=0; <br>
After being declared, a variable may be assigned a new value that will replace the old one: <br>
c=1; <br>
But make sure to declare a variable with var before (or while) assigning to it; otherwise you will create a "scope bug".

#Primitive Types
Primitive types are types provided by the system, in this case by JavaScript. Primitive types for JavaScript are booleans,
numbers, and text. In addition to the primitive types, users may define their own classes.
