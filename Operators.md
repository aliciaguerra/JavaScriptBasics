#JavaScript Operators
<b>Arithmetic Operators</b><br>
JavaScript has the arithmetic operators "+", "-", "*", "/", and "%". These operators function as an addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators, and operate very similarly to other languages. <br>
`v ar a=12+5; `  <br>
` var b=12-5; `  <br>
` var c=12*5; `  <br>
` var d=12/5; `  <br>
` var e=12%5; `  <br>
Some mathematical operations, such as dividing by zero, cause the returned variable to be one of the error values - for
example, infinity, or NaN. <br>
The return value of the modulus operator maintains the sign of the first operand.
