#JavaScript Operators
<b>Arithmetic Operators</b><br>
JavaScript has the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, and %. These operators function as an addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators, and operate very similarly to other languages. <br>
`var a=12+5; //17` <br>
`var b=12-5; //7` <br>
`var c=12*5; //60` <br>
`var d=12/5; //2.4 - division results in floating point numbers` <br>
`var e=12%5; //2 - the remiainder of 12/5 in integer math is 2` <br>
Some mathematical operations, such as dividing by zero, cause the returned variable to be one of the error values - for
example, infinity, or NaN. <br>
The return value of the modulus operator maintains the sign of the first operand.
