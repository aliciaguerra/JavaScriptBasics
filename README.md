# JavaScript
- JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language.
- It is most commonly used as a part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with
the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.
- It is used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development, and the creation of
desktop and mobile applications.
- With the rise of single page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target to source-to-source compilers from both dynamics languages and static languages.
- C and C++ programs can be compiled into JavaScript and execute at near-native speeds, making JavaScript be considered
"the Assembly language of the web".
- As in most scripting languages, types are associated with values, not variables. For example, a variable x could be bound to
a number, then later rebound to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of object, including duck typing.
